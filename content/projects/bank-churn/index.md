## 🧠 Project Summary

This project combines **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** with a **basic predictive modeling extension** applied to a real-world banking customer dataset.  
The original EDA was developed as a group academic assignment and later extended individually to frame and solve a **binary classification problem** focused on predicting customer churn (whether a customer will leave the bank)

## 📊 Dataset & Problem

- **Dataset:** Public banking customer dataset from Kaggle, containing 10,127 customers × 23 variables.  
- **Goal:** Understand customer behaviour through data exploration and build a simple, interpretable model to predict customer churn.  
- **Challenge:** Balance rigorous preprocessing and interpretable modeling over complexity.

---

## 🔧 Tools & Technologies

This project was built using:

- **Python**
- **pandas** / **numpy**
- **matplotlib**
- **scikit-learn**

All analysis and modeling is contained in a Jupyter Notebook provided in the repository.

## 📋 Approach

1. **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**
   - Inspect data shape, types and missing values
   - Handle outliers and convert categorical income ranges to numeric
   - Feature renaming and removal of redundant variables
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Descriptive statistics
   - Visual exploration of distributions and correlations
3. **Predictive Modeling**
   - Framed churn as a binary classification problem
   - Trained a **logistic regression model** for interpretability
   - Evaluated and improved the model using balancing and threshold adjustment
4. **Interpretation**
   - Interpreted model coefficients to understand drivers of churn.

## 📈 Key Insights

- **Multicollinearity** observed between credit limit and average open to buy
- **Transaction activity** differentiates customer profiles
- **Churn Indicators:** Lower activity and prolonged inactivity increase churn probability.
