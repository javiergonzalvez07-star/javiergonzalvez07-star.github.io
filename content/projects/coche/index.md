## Overview
This project uses **physics-based numerical simulation** to study the impact of **road friction** on vehicle braking distance and safety.  
By modeling braking dynamics under different surface conditions, the project connects **theoretical physics** with **real-world road safety implications**.

## Problem
Road conditions (wet asphalt, worn surfaces, low-friction materials) significantly affect braking performance.  
However, these effects are often underestimated in everyday driving.

The goal of this project is to **quantify** how changes in the friction coefficient directly influence:
- stopping distance,
- braking time,
- and collision likelihood.

---

## What I built
- A simplified physical model of vehicle braking based on Newtonian mechanics.
- Numerical simulations comparing braking distance for different friction coefficients.
- Scenario-based analysis to study safety margins under varying road conditions.
- Clear visualizations linking friction values to real safety outcomes.

---

## Key insights
- Braking distance scales **non-linearly** with friction losses.
- Small reductions in friction can dramatically reduce safety margins.
- Infrastructure quality and vehicle condition are equally critical for safety.

---

## Why it matters
This project highlights how **engineering decisions and material conditions** directly affect public safety.  
It demonstrates the value of simulation as a tool for:
- safety analysis,
- infrastructure assessment,
- and risk communication.

The focus is on **interpretability and reasoning**, not over-complicated models.
