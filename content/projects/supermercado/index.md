## Overview
This project is a **data-driven analysis and optimization study** focused on real-world supermarket operations.  
The objective is not only to analyze data, but to **support operational decisions** by modeling trade-offs, constraints, and optimization criteria relevant to retail environments.

## Problem
Supermarket operations involve multiple competing objectives:
- minimizing operational costs,
- maintaining service quality,
- and optimizing logistics and decision rules.

This project frames these challenges as **quantitative problems** that can be explored through data analysis and simulation.

---

## What I built
- Exploratory data analysis to understand operational patterns and constraints.
- Simple optimization and simulation approaches to test different strategies.
- Comparative analysis of outcomes under different assumptions and parameters.
- Clear interpretation of results from a **decision-making perspective**, not just statistical metrics.

---

## Key insights
- Small changes in operational rules can produce **non-linear effects** on overall efficiency.
- Optimization must balance performance gains with robustness and simplicity.
- Data analysis is most valuable when combined with **explicit decision criteria**.

---

## Why it matters
This project reflects how data analysis is applied in real business contexts:
- the goal is not a “perfect model”,
- but **better decisions under constraints and uncertainty**.

The focus is on reasoning, assumptions, and interpretability — skills directly transferable to engineering, analytics, and operations roles.
