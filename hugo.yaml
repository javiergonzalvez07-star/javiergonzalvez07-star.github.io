    title: "About Me"
    content: |
      I am a first-year student in Mathematical Engineering and Physics with a strong interest in Data Science and physical simulations.

      I enjoy building end-to-end projects: from data collection and cleaning, to modeling, simulation and decision-making.

      I regularly publish my work on GitHub and LinkedIn, and I am focused on developing a strong technical profile for future internships.
